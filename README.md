# To-Do List CLI Application

A simple command-line interface (CLI) To-Do List application written in Python. This app allows you to add, remove, view, and save tasks. It also loads the tasks from a file on startup and saves them before the program exits.

## Features
- Add tasks to your to-do list.
- Remove tasks from your list.
- View the current tasks in the list.
- Save tasks to a local file (`todo-list.txt`) to persist between sessions.
- Load tasks from the file when the program starts.
- Exit the program with an option to save the current list before quitting.
